### Hi there 👋 
### I'm Neslihan

I worked as a **Java Developer** for 2.5 years at a company, where I also took responsibility for managing **DevOps** processes within the team. During this time, I gained experience in **CI/CD** and learned to use tools like **Jenkins** to ensure fast and seamless deployment of applications.

Currently, I am pursuing post-baccalaureate studies in the Computer Science Program at Douglas College in Canada. Through my courses, I have learned **Android** application development, **Bash Scripting**, **Vue.js**, and **Node.js**.
